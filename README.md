  <summary><h2 style="display: inline-block"> 💻 Usage (runs devserver)
</h2></summary>

Make sure you have completed installation in the section above.

> 📜 Option 1 (script - unix systems only) (Only after you run `chmod +x ./scripts/install.sh`) :

```
cd to-do-app/
killall node

./scripts/run.sh
```

> ✏️ Option 2 (manual):

Since the app needs to run both the react development server and the express server, we have to run them in seperate terminal instances.

🖥️ Terminal 1:

```
cd to-do-app/frontend
npm run start
```

🖥️ Terminal 2:

```
cd to-do-app/backend
npm run start
```
